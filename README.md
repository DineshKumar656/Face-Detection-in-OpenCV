Face Detection using OpenCV 👤

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using the Haar Cascade Classifier provided by OpenCV. The program captures video from a webcam, processes each frame, and detects human faces by drawing bounding boxes around them.

🔧 Features

Real-time face detection from webcam

Uses OpenCV’s pre-trained Haar Cascade model

Highlights detected faces with bounding boxes

Lightweight and easy to implement

🖥️ Tech Stack
